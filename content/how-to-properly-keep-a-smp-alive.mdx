Hi everyone, I know this isn't a usual post on here but I just wanted to share my experience.

Running or managing a Minecraft SMP is fun, but keeping it alive long-term takes more than just good intentions. 
Here's a list of some things that can maybe help keep an SMP active and atleast a little bit enjoyable.

## Focus on the player base, not plugins or game mechanics.

The community is what keeps an SMP going. Features and plugins are really cool, but they shouldn’t mess with the players' experience. Keep it simple and make sure the server feels fun to play on.

## Don’t list features.

When promoting your server, talk about the type of community you’re trying to build, not just what plugins you’re running. People join because of the vibe of the community, not because you have a fancy custom-made plugin or mods.

## Skip the formal applications

Instead of using applications, try meeting people in Discord servers or communities. If someone already fits your style, that’s so much better than getting some random application.

## Keep players engaged

- Treat everyone the same.
- No cheating. Be strict about it.
- Let players vote on big changes with some suggestion channel on Discord.
- Encourage long-term goals and projects.
- Create ways for people to interact.
- Keep events rare so they feel special and fun to play.

## Try to keep the server size small

Around 12 to 25 active players is ideal. Big enough for interaction, small enough to avoid chaos. Also let the community decide how long each season lasts.

## Try to select new players

Only invite people who fit. It’s better to have a smaller group of people than a big one full of inactive or random disruptive players. If possible, add new members early in the season.
If it's a public server that you promoted on Tiktok, it's better to tell the viewers about what vibes you want on the server than for it to be another random Minecraft SMP that's gonna die in 1 week.

## How you host your servers.

Avoid oversold or hyped server hosts. Smaller hosting companies are usually better. If you’re serious, you could consider running your own server.

## Only add what you think matters to the player base.

Don’t fill the server with random stuff. If something doesn’t improve gameplay in a good and meaningful way then just skip it. Everything that gets added should serve a purpose.

## Know what you are trying to build.

Figure out what kind of SMP you want before you start builder-focused, roleplay, survival, pvp, etc. That helps guide your server setup and who you invite.

## Give people credit

Appreciate the people who help. Mods, devs, players—say thanks. A bit of recognition can go a long way.

These are just things that’ve worked well over time. Every SMP is different, but community-first servers always last longer.
It's been a while since I've seen a good Minecraft SMP, even the one I managed so I thought I would post some tips for someone who is trying their best to improve their Minecraft SMP.

I know it's not like my other blog posts so far but I hope it's useful enough.
