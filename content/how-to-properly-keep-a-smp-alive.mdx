hi peeps, this isn't the usual blog post here but i just thought it should be kept somewhere.

running or managing a minecraft smp is pretty fun, but keeping it alive for a while takes more than just good intentions.
here is a list of some things that can maybe help keep a minecraft smp active and or atleast enjoyable.

## focus on the players, not plugins or game mechanics.

the players are who keeps your smp going. features and plugins are really cool, but they shouldn’t mess with the players' experience as much. keep it fairly simple and make sure the server feels fun to play on.

## don’t list features.

when trying promoting your server, talk about the player base you are trying to build, not just what plugins you are going to be running. people join for the vibes, not because you have a fancy custom-made plugin or mods with skript or something.

## skip the formal entry applications

instead of using applications, try meeting people in random discord servers or communities. if someone already fits your style, that gonna be so much better than getting some random application.

## keep your players engaged

- treat everyone the same.
- no cheating. be strict about it or not (2b2t).
- let players vote on big changes with some suggestion channel on a discord server.
- encourage long-term goals and projects, not just grind for netherite armor and log off.
- create ways for people to interact with each other.
- keep events rare so they feel special and fun to play.

## try to keep the server size small

around 12 to 25 active players is good. big enough for interaction, small enough to avoid most chaos and it also lets the community decide how long each season lasts.
it doesn't sound good but having arguments or chaos for small things make people really annoyed and stop playing on your server.

## try to select new players

only invite people who fit. it is better to have a smaller group of people than a big one full of inactive or random disruptive players. if possible, add new members early in the season.
if it is gonna be a public server that you promoted on tiktok or twitch, it is better to tell the viewers about what vibes you want on the server than for it to be another random minecraft smp that's gonna die in 2-3 week.

## how you host your servers.

avoid oversold or hyped server hosts. smaller hosting companies are usually better. if you’re serious, you could consider running your own server.

## only add what you think matters to the player base.

don’t fill the server with random shit. if something doesn’t improve gameplay in a good way then just skip it. everything that gets added should serve a purpose and not be useless junk that adds up to 100+ plugins or mods.

## know what you are trying to build.

figure out what kind of smp you want before you start builds, roleplay, survival, pvp, etc. that helps guide your server setup and who you invite.

## give people credit

appreciate the people who help. mods, devs, players -- say thanks. a bit of recognition can go a long way.

these are just things that have worked well over time. every smp is different, but community-first servers usually last longer.
it's been a while since I've seen a good minecraft smp, even the one i managed so i thought i would post some tips for someone who is trying to improve their minecraft smp for the better or worse, i wouldn't know.

i know it's not like my other blog posts so far but i hope it is gonna be useful enough for the next person.
