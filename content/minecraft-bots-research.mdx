description: an updated research to my Minecraft Bots powered by LLMs post
---

hi people, it’s been sometime since my last project blog post. 
let’s just say i’ve been busy with some stuff and haven’t gotten the time to work on them like i was going to.

about my [Minecraft Bots powered by LLMs](https://www.khaodoes.dev/blog/minecraft-bots-powered-by-llms) post, i think most of you have heard of Altera.AL but if you haven’t, [Fundamental Research Labs also known as Altera.AL](https://altera.al) is a research company building autonomous, collaborative agents. they began their research in games like Minecraft and Roblox and some time ago, they made [Project Sid](https://github.com/altera-al/project-sid) which is a many-agent civilization powered by LLMs ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00114)). 
it was an insanely cool project and huge props to them for making it because it showed me what things LLMs can do with Minecraft bots.

with that explanation out of the way, they recently decided to [open-source their project as a MCP](https://github.com/FundamentalLabs/minecraft-mcp). 
from how cool that already is, it seems to be working as what i was trying to do before i found [Mindcraft](https://github.com/kolbytn/mindcraft).

however, there seems to be a limitation in both Project Sid and Mindcraft. they are both utilizing [PrismarineJS’s Mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer) project, which is a way to create Minecraft bots “with a powerful, stable, and high level JavaScript API”. now as good as the Mineflayer project is currently, it isn’t the best.

from my research, i feel like when i have time to i will have to change and refactor my project a lot from what i originally envisioned it was going to be and i hope to update you guys soon. 

for now, cya nerds later.
