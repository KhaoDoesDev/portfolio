description: reasoning behind the website's redesign
---

hey people, it's been a while since i last updated my website. i've been working on a new design for it, and i wanted to share my thoughts on why i made the changes.

i just felt that my website looked too good for someone who's not a professional developer. i wanted to make it more approachable and user-friendly, and i think i've achieved that.

anyways, just a little bit of explanation on why i made the changes to my website. cya nerds.
