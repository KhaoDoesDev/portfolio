Hi everyone, this is my second blog post on my portfolio.
I initially made the blog just for this post to share my research and experience using LLMs
and intergrating them into Minecraft bots.

## About the project

The project is a project that implements LLMs into controlling Minecraft bots and interacting with the environment
inside the Minecraft server. The bot is able to follow instructions and communicate with players on the server.

## Project Development

I started working on this project after reading the code of MINDcraft. MINDcraft was inspired by the
NVIDIA's Voyager project, MINDcraft and this project are both very different from that project.

I already had experience with building Minecraft bots with mineflayer (a popular Minecraft bot library used to
make Minecraft bots with high-level Javascript) previously.

This project uses a similar approach to MINDcraft by using similar commands for the LLMs to interact with the Minecraft bot
like `!nearbyBlocks({ "x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0 })` to get nearby blocks. I've also recently seen that in the MINDcraft project,
they optionally make the LLMs make Javascript code to run new actions on the bot that weren't there with the in built commands however it's very dangerous.

Before the exclamation mark commands, the Minecraft bots actually used inbuilt tool calling / function calling inside LLMs to call the functions to move around.
This was a really confusing process because of the Vercel AI SDK having steps, steps are basically another or multiple calls to the LLM after the first call to generate a response for the end-user.
I really thought function calling was the best way to go about it but I was wrong and eventually went with the exclamation mark commands that MINDcraft used.

Over time of development, the Minecraft bots has been given more and more functions to interact and get context of the Minecraft world and the Minecraft bot itself.

## How it works

The Minecraft bot is made with mineflayer, a popular Minecraft bot library that you can make Minecraft bots with high-level Javascript.
The Vercel AI SDK is also used to integrate LLMs into the bot but any would have worked like the official Ollama SDK for JS.

Here is some pseudocode of how the bot works:
```pseudocode
actionLogs = [] # Action logs contain what the bot has done
chatMessages = [] # Chat messages from users
messages = []
event onSpawn:
  while true:
    messages.push({ 
      role: "user", 
      # The LLMs are given the botContext, chatMessages, and actionLogs
      content: botContext + chatMessages + actionLogs 
    })
    response = await ai.generateMessage(messages)
    messages.push(response)
    if (response.containsCommands()):
      response.commands.forEach((command, args) => {
        commandResponse = await runCommand(command, args)
        messages.push({ role: "assistant", content: commandResponse })
      })
    sendMessage(response.content)
    # Reset all logs for next run
    actionLogs = []
    chatMessages = []
    sleep(2500)

event onChat:
  chatMessages.push(message)

event onDeath:
  actionLogs.push("Bot died")
```

## Reoccurring Problems

I've encountered a few problems while developing this project.
Here are a few of them:

### The bot doesn't know crafting recipes
Sometimes the bot doesn't know how to craft a certain item even with a recipe command. 
For example, when crafting a crafting table, it sometimes doesn't get the idea that an oak log and an oak plank aren't the same thing.

### The bot gets stuck in a loop
Sometimes the bot gets stuck in a loop and doesn't know how to move around. 
This is because the LLMs are not able to understand the context of the bot and the Minecraft world.
The only solution to this is to restart the bot.

## Improvements for the future

Currently, the Minecraft bot isn't very advanced and all pathfinding are done automatically with an algorithm like A*.
The LLM doesn't have full control of the Minecraft bot. The LLM doesn't control or decide what way to go while navigating except
choosing the coordinates of where to move to.

The LLM doesn't actually look for a certain block and scans the entire area around it to find the block, this can't be fixed without vision
capabilities from the LLMs but the full vision functionality on mineflayer isn't done yet.
